# Inventory-Man-Back-end
This is the backend component of an inventory system project developed using Node.js and MongoDB. The backend is responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and authentication functionalities.

Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in the development of the backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data.
jsonwebtoken: A library used for generating and verifying JSON web tokens (JWTs) for authentication and authorization purposes.
mongoose: An Object-Document Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a simplified schema-based solution for interacting with the database.
nodemon: A development tool that automatically restarts the server when changes are detected, improving the development workflow.
express: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
Getting Started
To get the backend up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend
Install the dependencies: npm install
Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory and provide the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection URI, JWT secret, etc.).
Start the server: npm start or nodemon if you have it installed globally.
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.
